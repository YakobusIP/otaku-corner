Despite the fact that Tomozaki is the number one player in the video game Attack Families, he is a self-proclaimed bottom-tier character when it comes to real life.

She fits the role of a perfect heroine and is on the opposite end of the social spectrum from Tomozaki. However, after a chance encounter with Hinami, Tomozaki realizes that she is not a perfect character after all!\n\nSo begins a story of drama and romance revolving around Tomozaki's attempts at conquering the game of life under Hinami's guidance.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
