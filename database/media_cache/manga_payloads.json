He is the complete opposite of someone like his younger sister Sachi, who is a reflection of her extroverted parents. Thus, it should come as no surprise that Nagi was swapped with another baby at birth.\n\nOn the way to meet his true parents, Nagi encounters Erika Amano, a young social media star. While spending the day with her, he learns that Erika's parents forced a marriage onto her. Later that day, Nagi comes to learn that Erika's fianc\u00e9 is actually none other than himself, in order to officially be part of each other's family. With the goal to build the pair's relationship, Nagi's biological father arranges for the fianc\u00e9s to start living together! However, no matter what tricks their parents pull, Nagi refuses to marry Erika. That is because he already has sights set on someone else: the beautiful and intelligent Hiro Segawa.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Fortunately, it seems he's on the right path, ranking first in the nation's mock exams and set to enter his high school of choice. \n\nHowever, everything changes in a single night when he notices a girl across the street on his way home. Enraptured by her overwhelming cuteness, it's love at first sight for Nasa. But in his infatuated daze, he fails to notice the approaching danger speeding down the road and finds himself at death's door. Barely alive thanks to the girl's intervention, Nasa musters the courage to confess his love to her, fearing she might otherwise vanish from his life. She accepts his proposal on one condition: marriage, to which Nasa gladly accepts before passing out from his injuries. Upon waking, however, the girl is nowhere to be found.\n\nAfter recovering from his injuries, Nasa tosses his previous ambitions aside and dedicates his life to finding the girl that captured his heart, yet several years pass to no avail. But one night, when an unexpected visitor comes knocking on his door, Nasa finds himself facing a woman that would forever change his world: his wife.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Now burdened with the arduous task of rebuilding membership, he struggles to recruit anyone due to a lack of interest. Just as Kurata has lost nearly all hope in keeping the club alive, the feared delinquent Chika Kudou appears, claiming he will join and become the club president himself.\n\nAt first, Kurata refuses to admit such a troublesome person, aware of the dark rumors that have been circulating about Kudou. However, after discovering a more vulnerable side to Kudou and his mysterious connection to the club, Kurata rethinks his decision. The soon-to-be defunct club is saved with the help of koto prodigy Satowa Houzuki, who uses her charms to recruit Kudou's lively friends Saneyasu Adachi, Michitaka Sakai, and Kouta Mizuhara.\n\nWith sufficient numbers to retain the club's status, Houzuki declares that they will aim to become the best koto players in the nation, much to Kurata's dismay. This ragtag bunch of young musicians have a road filled with challenges and adversities ahead of them, and by overcoming their fears and differences, their aspirations may very well come true.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But Takamine has a secret\u2014she possesses an ability called \"Eternal Virgin Road,\" allowing her to redo past actions and achieve a different result.\n\nWhile this might seem like a decent skill to have, Takamine must pay a price to activate it: she has to strip off a piece of her lingerie. After getting an imperfect score on a test, Takamine begins to remove her underwear during class and is spotted by her average and weak-willed classmate Koushi Shirota, who is bewildered by the sight. However, the very next instant, things reset and Takamine's test is now perfect.\n\nWhen Shirota decides to confront Takamine about her previous test score, she reveals her ability to him and blackmails him into becoming her \"closet,\" making him carry around extra lingerie and put them on her. Her goal is to be able to use Eternal Virgin Road as much as possible in order to stay at the top of the school hierarchy. Left with little choice in the matter, Shirota accepts, starting an oddly intimate type of relationship with the most popular girl at school.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
